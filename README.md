    <h3>SDK Generator</h3>
</div>


## Project structure

Most of them are auto-generated.

| Folder | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| [/static](static) | Static files, most of them (!) will be copied straight to the SDK repository itself. |
| [/static/types](static/types) | Static types, which can be imported and used by the generated SDK. |
| [/static/docs](static/docs) | Documentation templates, filled by the generator and copied to [sdk/docs](sdk/docs). |
| [/src](src) | Source code for the generator itself. |
| [/sdk](sdk) | The generated repository will end up here. Source-files are bundle via [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/). |
| [/sdk/src](sdk/src) | Will contain the raw source files generated by the generator.  |
| [/coverage](coverage) | After running tests, you can find your coverage files from [jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) here. |

Based on the project structure, building is done in two steps:
1. Generating the raw SDK code into [sdk/src](sdk/src) and partial documentation into [sdk/docs](sdk/docs).
2. Bundling the code in [sdk/src](sdk/src) into the given targets (for example [sdk/node](sdk/node)).

After building it, check out the generated repository under [sdk](sdk) for further documentation!


## Setup

Copy the [.env.example](.env.example) to [.env](.env) and configure it accordingly. Use the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to convert your
swagger.json to the [OpenAPI v3](https://swagger.io/specification/) format.

### Development

There are a few scripts during development:

* `npm run gen:dev` _- Watches the generator's content files and re-generates the SDK on every change._
* `npm run sdk:dev` _- Watches the SDK itself and bundles it every time to be used in, for example, tests._
* `npm run lint:fix` _- Lints both the generator, and the generated SDK. Fixes errors where possible._
* `npm run test:coverage` _- Test the SDK and collect code-coverage._

The former two are started separately, as errors may occur independently of each other.

To use your freshly created SDK, you can refer to it locally to test it (replace `SDK_PATH` with the absolute path of the [SDK](sdk)): 
```json5
{
    // ...inside of your package.json
    "dependencies": {
        "@weclapp/sdk": "file:SDK_PATH",
        // ...other dependencies...
    }
}
```

### Production

To generate a production-ready SDK, simply run `npm run build`. This will generate the SDK and bundle it into the [SDK](sdk) folder. The process should finish without
errors.

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) will install all dependencies for this project. After building it, it can be used to generate the sdk and test it.
For this environmental variables must be set and `npm` commands run in the container.

##### Testing

If you also want to run tests you'll _additionally_ need the following:
* `RUN_TESTS` _- Set to `true` (or any other non-empty value)._
* `TEST_DOMAIN` _- API to test against (just the domain, e.g. `support.test2-y4jnp8qvg1.internal.weclapp.com`)._
* `TEST_API_KEY` _- API-Key._
